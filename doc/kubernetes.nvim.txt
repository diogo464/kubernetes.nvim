KUBERNETES.NVIM                              *kubernetes.nvim-kubernetes.nvim*

kubernetes.nvim fetches resource definitions from your cluster and feeds them
to yamlls.


REQUIREMENTS                                    *kubernetes.nvim-requirements*

This plugin requires the `kubectl` binary and the `yamlls` language server
installed through `mason.nvim`. The `kubectl` binary must be able to contact
the a kubernetes cluster to fetch the resource definitions.


INSTALLATION AND SETUP                *kubernetes.nvim-installation-and-setup*

To install the plugin any of the package managers should work. To install using
`lazy.nvim` just add the following line next to the other plugins.

>lua
        { 'diogo464/kubernetes.nvim' }
<

When the plugin is imported it will automatically generate and patch yamlls.
The only configuration required is in setting up yamlls. To do that just insert
the schema like in the example below.

>lua
          yamlls = {
            yaml = {
              schemas = {
                [require('kubernetes').yamlls_schema()] = "*.yaml",
              }
            }
          }
<


API                                                      *kubernetes.nvim-api*

`kubernetes.setup({opts})`

Generates the schema file and patches yamlls. At the moment this function takes
no options.

`kubernetes.generate_schema()`

Generates the schema file, replacing any existing one, and restarts yamlls.

`kubernetes.yamlls_schema()`

Returns the path to the schema file that should be given to yamlls.


HOW IT WORKS                                    *kubernetes.nvim-how-it-works*

In here I will just briefly describe how this plugin works and write down any
notes that might be useful when I come back to this later.

`yamlls` uses a set of schemas to provide autocompletion and hover support for
all fields in a yaml file. For kubernetes, an example schema can be found here:

>
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema/master/v1.20.5-standalone-strict/all.json
<

That json file is basically just a bunch of references to each of the
kubernetes resources that goes on for hundreds of lines. Here is a snippet of
that file:

>json
    {
      "oneOf": [
        {
          "$ref": "_definitions.json#/definitions/io.k8s.api.admissionregistration.v1.MutatingWebhook"
        },
        {
          "$ref": "_definitions.json#/definitions/io.k8s.api.admissionregistration.v1.MutatingWebhookConfiguration"
        }
    }
<

Each of those references points to objects in another file, in this case that
is:

>
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema/master/v1.20.5-standalone-strict/_definitions.json
<

That file contains all the actual resource definitions that are needed.

The problem is that it does not include any of the CRDs that you might have in
your cluster and at the time of writing I couldn’t find any easy way to add
support for them.

So to add support here are the steps:

1. Fetch the all the resource definitions from the cluster.  This can be achieved
like so: `kubectl get --raw /openapi/v2 | jq '.definitions'`.


2. Generate a `definitions.json` and `schema.json`.  The `schema.json` is that
`all.json` file that has the `oneOf`. To do this just get all iterate the
`definitions.json` and add the appropriate entry into `schema.json`. To
reference a local file use `file://<full path>#/definitions/...`.


3. Patch the yaml language server.  Right now kubernetes support seems to be
hardcoded into `yamlls`. Trying to use this generated schema without
modifications will give out the error `Matches multiple schemas when only one
must validate.`. The language server has an check to see if the current
document is a kubernetes document and if so then ignore that error.

<

But from what I could find the only way of having a document be a kubernetes
document is if the uri of the schema file associated with that document is the
hardcoded one.

<

The language server has an option to use an http proxy and I initially tought
that we could just make a proxy, then intercept any requests to that uri and
return our own. But it turns out http proxies don’t proxy individual requests
and instead just forward the byte stream to another server and since the
request for that uri will be made over httpt this option doesn’t really work.

So instead of doing any of that remove the check we can just remove the
requirement for a document to be a kubernetes document and always ignore that
error. Since the language server is written in javascript that turns out to be
quite simple, it is just a string replacement.

And thats it, now it works.
